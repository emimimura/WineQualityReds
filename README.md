# The Secret to Good Red Wine
<p>What makes a good wine? Could acidity change the quality of a wine? 
How about alcohol? pH level? Could any component of a wine determine 
its greatness?</p>

<p>In this project, I've analyzed which chemical properties produced a good red 
wine. The dataset contains red wines with the chemical properties of the wine.
At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating 
between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). My goal was to look at the levels 
of each attribute of these wines with their ratings to find some patterns and 
find the key elements to good red wines.</p>

<p>Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):<br>
   1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)<br>
   2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)<br>
   3 - citric acid (g / dm^3)<br>
   4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3)<br>
   5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3<br>
   6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)<br>
   7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)<br>
   8 - density (g / cm^3)<br>
   9 - pH<br>
   10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)<br>
   11 - alcohol (% by volume)<br>
   Output variable (based on sensory data): <br>
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)</p>
